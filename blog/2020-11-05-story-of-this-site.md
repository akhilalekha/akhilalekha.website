I have used [**Docusaurus v2**](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) to create this website. This is an open-source react based static site generator by facebook primarily for documentation purposes. I really liked the UI of the documentation sites I saw which was made with this.

<!-- Also I came across the personal site of a team member of this tool and I liked it. I wasn't sure about the tool that I wanted to use. Gatsby looked really scary to me. And I didn't know Next.js yet. But it's on my list :blush: Although I haven't used a single static site generator before, I felt like I could try this. It came with mdx support for blogs and that pretty much covers all I want for a personal site.

But I might probably redo it all again in a different framework to have more flexibility and control and to explore :joy: But as of now I'm glad to have found this :blush: -->
